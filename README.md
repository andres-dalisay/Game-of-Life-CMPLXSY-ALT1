# Game of Life with Von Neumann Neighborhood

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using NetLogo with normal rules but with the addition of an option to use a Von Neumann neighborhood instead of the Moore neighborhood; that is, only the four cells directly above, below, left, and right of a cell are considered when determining the next state of the cell.

Partially based off of the "Life" model included with NetLogo. Logic for the rules was written from scratch.
